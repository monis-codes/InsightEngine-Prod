# 🧠 Insight Engine: Intelligent Document Analysis with RAG

A lightweight, production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that transforms any PDF document into an intelligent, queryable knowledge base. Built for developers who need to demonstrate sophisticated AI capabilities without the overhead of expensive infrastructure.

## 🌟 Why Insight Engine?

In today's information-rich world, extracting meaningful insights from lengthy documents is a critical challenge. Insight Engine solves this by creating an intelligent layer over your documents, allowing you to ask natural language questions and receive precise, contextual answers.

**Perfect for:**
- Technical documentation analysis
- Research paper exploration  
- Legal document review
- Educational content interaction
- Business report analysis

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Insight Engine implements a complete RAG pipeline optimized for efficiency and accuracy:

```
PDF Input → Smart Chunking → Vector Embeddings → Semantic Search → LLM Generation
    ↓              ↓               ↓               ↓              ↓
 Text Extraction → Context Preservation → Knowledge Base → Relevance Ranking → Precise Answers
```

### Core Components

**1. 📄 Intelligent Document Processing**
- Robust PDF text extraction with formatting preservation
- Smart chunking algorithm that respects sentence boundaries
- Strategic overlap maintenance for context continuity
- Metadata retention for enhanced retrieval accuracy

**2. 🎯 Advanced Chunking Strategy**
Our proprietary smart chunking algorithm goes beyond simple text splitting:
- Sentence-aware segmentation prevents context loss
- Dynamic chunk sizing based on content complexity
- Intelligent overlap zones for seamless context flow
- Semantic coherence validation

**3. ⚡ High-Performance Vector Operations**
- Google's state-of-the-art `text-embedding-004` model
- 768-dimensional embeddings for rich semantic representation
- Pinecone vector database for millisecond retrieval speeds
- Cosine similarity matching for precise relevance ranking

**4. 🤖 Intelligent Response Generation**
- Powered by Google's `gemini-2.5-flash` for fast, accurate responses
- Context-aware generation with source attribution
- Hallucination prevention through strict context grounding
- Configurable response length and style

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google AI API access
- Pinecone account

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/monis-codes/rag-Deploy.git
cd rag-Deploy

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
